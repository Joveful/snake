# Snake

My dumb attempt at creating the classic game in C. This is just and exercise to practice my C skills and to learn how to use SDL2 for GUI.

## Requirements

The GUI has been implemented with `SDL2` and `SDL2_TTF`.

## Installation

`cd` into the project directory and run `make` to compile the project.

## Running the game

After compiling the project, run `./snake` to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
